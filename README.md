# Credit_Card-Fraud-Detection
Implemented a credit card fraud detection system using machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest Classifier, to detect fraudulent transactions and minimize financial losses for a banking institution
# Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
(The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.)

Utilized the Random Forest Classifier, a powerful ensemble learning algorithm, for its ability to handle imbalanced datasets and effectively capture complex relationships within the data.
Conducted rigorous evaluation using cross-validation techniques to ensure the model's robustness and generalization ability, thereby minimizing false positives and false negatives.

# With RandomForrestClassifier, for which I obtained an AUC scode of 0.85 when predicting the target for the test set.
